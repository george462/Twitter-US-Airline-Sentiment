## **Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis**  

### **Overview**  
This repository contains code and models for sentiment analysis on the **Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset**. The dataset, originally collected by Crowdflower, includes tweets from customers about U.S. airlines, labeled with sentiment categories: **positive, neutral, or negative**.  

### **Dataset Information**  
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Twitter US Airline Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)  
- **Size:** ~14,640 tweets  
- **Columns:**  
  - `tweet_id` â€“ Unique tweet ID  
  - `airline_sentiment` â€“ Sentiment label (**positive, neutral, negative**)  
  - `airline_sentiment_confidence` â€“ Confidence score for sentiment  
  - `negativereason` â€“ If negative, the reason (e.g., "Late Flight", "Customer Service Issue")  
  - `airline` â€“ Airline name (e.g., "American", "United")  
  - `text` â€“ The actual tweet content  
  - `tweet_created` â€“ Date and time of tweet creation  

### **Project Goals**  
- Perform **sentiment analysis** to classify tweets into **positive, negative, or neutral** categories.  
- Use **NLP techniques** (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT) to preprocess and analyze tweets.  
- Train **machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).  
- Experiment with **deep learning** (LSTMs, Transformers) for better sentiment classification.  

### **Installation & Requirements**  
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-airline-sentiment.git
cd twitter-airline-sentiment
```
Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Usage**  
Run the sentiment analysis pipeline:  
```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

### **Models Used**  
- **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SVM  
- **Word Embedding:** TF-IDF, Word2Vec, FastText  
- **Deep Learning:** LSTMs, BERT-based models  

### **Results & Findings**  
- Majority of tweets are **negative (~62%)**, with **customer service complaints** being a major issue.  
- **BERT-based models** outperformed traditional ML models in sentiment classification.
